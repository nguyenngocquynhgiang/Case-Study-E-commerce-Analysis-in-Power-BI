# Case Study: Ecommerce Analysis in Power BI

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Analysis in Power BI** case study! This project explores a real-world ecommerce business dataset to uncover insights for an online pet supply company called **Whiskique**. Using **Power Query**, I investigate and clean the data to evaluate the company’s sales performance and customer distribution.

Additionally, I employ **DAX** to build insightful visualizations and, finally, integrate all findings into a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** that enables the executive team to make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview
This case study consists of three key phases:

### 1. Data Exploration
- Build a data model for sales and expense analysis.
- Combine multiple files and filter out invalid data.
- Create key customer and order metrics.
- Utilize **Power Query** to determine frequently purchased products.

### 2. Ecommerce Analytics
- Develop metrics to identify the most profitable products and customers.
- Build a **sales-by-state map** for geographic insights.
- Analyze shipping cost metrics and their impact on profitability.
- Implement a **what-if analysis** to explore the effects of bulk shipping on costs.

### 3. Visualization and Insights
- Design **dashboard-style pages** to present findings effectively.
- Showcase **key performance indicators (KPIs)** for products and customers.
- Develop interactive visuals for better data storytelling.
- Provide strategic recommendations to optimize shipping costs and improve profitability.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (Power Query, DAX, Data Visualization)
- **Excel** (Data Preprocessing)
- **Data Modeling** Techniques
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** Process

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, users will:
- Understand the **sales performance** and **customer demographics** of Whiskique.
- Gain insights into the **profitability of products and customers**.
- Assess **shipping cost efficiency** and explore cost-saving strategies.
- Use Power BI dashboards to make **data-driven decisions**.

## Conclusion
This **Power BI Ecommerce Analysis** project provides valuable insights into Whiskique’s business operations. By leveraging data analytics, visualization, and modeling techniques, the executive team can make informed decisions to enhance business growth and optimize operational efficiency.
